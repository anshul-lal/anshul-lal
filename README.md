# 💫 About Me:
I am a Senior Product Analyst and Data Analyst with over four years of experience using data to inform product strategy, experimentation, and decision making. I hold an MSc in Business Analytics and Big Data from the University of Liverpool, completed with distinction, and have worked on large scale learning and digital products serving millions of users.<br><br>My work focuses on product analytics, experimentation, and behavioural analysis. I have led A/B tests and randomised experiments, designed event tracking frameworks, and translated complex datasets into clear insights for product and leadership teams. I am comfortable working end to end, from defining metrics and hypotheses to analysis and stakeholder communication.<br><br>I primarily work with SQL, Python, and BI tools such as Power BI and Looker, alongside product analytics platforms including Mixpanel, Matomo, and Google Analytics. My interests include funnel and cohort analysis, retention and activation metrics, and building statistically sound, decision oriented analytics workflows.
